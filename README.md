## Genshin Wish Simulator

This project is still a work-in-progress. I'm creating this as a fan and active player of the game [Genshin Impact](https://genshin.mihoyo.com/). The entire app's data and state is locally stored.

Majority of the images were taken from third-party sites with videos recorded by me.

## `npm script`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## `firebase emulators:start`

If you have the firebase-cli globally installed, this will run an emulation of hosting for the site.
